Using sensors to receive real time data of a foot over bridge to help make predictions using Machine Learning model

Sensors Used:
1. Humidity and Temperature Sensor(DHT11)
2. Ultrasonic Sensor(HC-SR04)
3. PIR Motion Sensor
4. LDR Sensor

The sensors are Integrated with ESP8266MOD.

The real time data is used to generate a Machine Learning model to predict the activity of the Foot Over Bridge and help in maintenance.
Logistic Regression is the algorithm used. 

Blynk App is used to see the output
